		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>I previously attened <a href="https://www.eiu.edu">Eastern Illinois University.</a>  I graduated in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in 2D Art.  While there, I was in various organization.  I was a member of Alpha Sigma Tau sorority.  I was also a member of Art Associtaion, Women's Empowerment League and EIU Striders (a running club.) </p>
		<p>I just recently returned from a semester abroad in Ireland.  There, I studied humanities at <a href="http://www.carlowcollege.ie"> Carlow College St. Patrick's.</a></p>
		<p>I am currently studying Graphic Design at Parkland College.  It has been quite an adjustment going from painting and drawing classes to working mainly with computers.  It's a lot less of a messy process, though!</p>  
		<p>Some of my favorite mediums to work with are:</p>
		
		<li>Oil paint</li>
		<li>Water colors</li>
		<li>Acrylic paint</li>
		<li>Digital platforms</li>
		<li>Pen and ink</li>
		<li>Colored pencil</li>

		<h2>Home Life</h2>
		<p>I currently live around the Champaign area with my two dogs, Boz and Yogi.  Boz is a two-year-old yellow lab.  Yogi is a one-year-old aussie-poo (Austrailian shepherd/poodle mix)  Both are handful!</p>
		<p>I grew up on my family's farm with lots of black angus cattle.  In addition to cattle, we also grow corn and beans.</p>
		<p>I like to go to the downtown areas of Champaign/Urbana.  I usally take my dogs for a walk through the parks where they can go out and get plenty of attention from other people!</p>

		<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>During my free time, I have many hobbies and acitivies I like to spend time doing.  I enjoy long distance running and weight lifting out.  I also like spending time outside, whether it's going for a hike or simply relaxing outside in the sun. </p>
		<p>I also like to spend time drawing, painting and making different pieces of art.  I just discover how to make digital painting, so I have been spending a lot of my time trying to practice more at it. </p>
		<p>I enjoy traveling and planning.  Whever there is an opportunity to travel, I try to take advantage of it.  There are plenty of places I enjoy returning to like Florida or North Carolina, but I alway like discovering new places!</p>
		<p>I had a great opportunity while studying abroad to see a few other countries.  While abroad, I visited:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Republic of Ireland</li>
			<li>2. North Ireland</li>
			<li>3. Scotland</li>
			<li>4. England</li>
			<li>5. Greece</li>
			<li>6. The Netherlands</li>
